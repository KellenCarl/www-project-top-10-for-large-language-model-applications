# ASI Agentic Exploits & Incidents Master List

The ASI Exploits and Incidents is intended to help inform and ground our **OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications** to real world incidents and exploits.  
It will contribute to but not substitute any existing vulnerability reporting in the **GenAI Security project**.  
Similarly, any aspects relating to incident response should be discussed with the **CTI initiative** that publishes the incident response guide.

## Guidelines
- Must **NOT** repeat other vendors but reference their work.  
- Must analyse incidents with **agentic threats in mind** — not just LLM classifications like *data leaks* and *prompt injection*.  
- Must focus on **agentic applications** (as defined in the ASI Threats & Mitigations) and distinguish them from *simple chatbots*.  

**Lead:** Ron F. Del Rosario
