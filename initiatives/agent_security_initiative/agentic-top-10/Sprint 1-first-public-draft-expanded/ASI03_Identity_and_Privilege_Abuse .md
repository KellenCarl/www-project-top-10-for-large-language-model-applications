## ASI03 â€“ Identity & Privilege Abuse

**Description:**

Identity & Privilege Abuse is the exploitation of dynamic trust relationships and delegation chains between autonomous AI agents to escalate privileges and bypass security controls. Unlike static privilege escalation, attackers exploit the dynamic delegation chains that agents create autonomously manipulating how AI agents inherit, transfer, and act on permissions across interconnected systems. The vulnerability can occur through the direct manipulation of permissions, exploitation of role inheritance, hijacking of control systems, or exploitation of the agent's context (e.g., memory, conversation history). 

**Common Examples of Risk:**

1. **Unscoped Privilege Inheritance:** This vulnerability arises when a high-privilege "manager" agent delegates a task to a lower-privilege "worker" agent without properly scoping its permissions. This often occurs for developer convenience or due to architectural limitations, where the system simply passes the parent's entire security context. The worker agent, designed for a narrow task, now possesses excessive permissions to access data or execute functions it doesn't need. Another example is default privileges held by low/no-code agents. i.e. access to the Internet by default and resulting privilege inheritance.

2. **Memory-Based Privilege Retention & Data Leakage:** Agents often cache data including credentials, API keys, retrieved (RAG), or other sensitive information from previous tasks in their session memory to maintain context and improve performance. This risk occurs when that memory is not properly segmented or cleared between different tasks or user sessions. An attacker can then exploit this persistence in a subsequent, lower-trust context. They can craft prompts that trick the agent into accessing its own memory and either reusing the cached credentials to escalate privileges or leaking sensitive data processed in a previous, secure context into the current, insecure one.

3. **Cross-Agent Trust Exploitation (Confused Deputy):** In a multi-agent system, agents are often designed to implicitly trust requests from one another to function efficiently. This risk, a classic "Confused Deputy" problem, occurs when an attacker compromises a low-privilege agent and uses it as a trusted proxy to send a deceptive but validly formatted request to a high-privilege agent. The high-privilege agent, seeing a request from a known internal component, executes the action without re-validating the original user's intent or authority, thereby misusing its legitimate permissions on behalf of the attacker.

4. **Delegation Chain Abuse & Control-Flow Hijacking:** This is a sophisticated attack that targets the orchestration logic of a multi-step agentic workflow. An attacker injects a malicious instruction or manipulates metadata (like task plans or action histories) early in a delegation chain. As the task is passed from agent to agent, the malicious payload is carried along, trusted by each subsequent agent. The goal is to have a downstream agent, which may have much higher privileges, execute a high-impact, unauthorized action. Control-flow hijacking is a variant where the manipulated metadata doesn't just alter an action but redirects the entire task to an attacker-controlled agent or tool.

5. **Credential and Token Mismanagement:** This risk covers the insecure handling of the secrets that grant agents their power. It can manifest in several ways: developers hardcoding API keys in agent code, agents storing secrets insecurely in logs or memory, or agents being manipulated via prompt injection to reveal their own credentials. Unlike other risks that abuse an agent's actions, this one targets the agent's identity itself. The compromise of a single, long-lived token can give an attacker direct, persistent access to underlying APIs and systems.

6. **Orphaned and Temporal Privilege Persistence:** This vulnerability is created when temporary, elevated permissions assigned to an agent for a specific task are not properly or promptly revoked after the task is complete. Inadequate session cleanup, bugs in the role revocation logic, or overly long session timeouts can leave an agent in a privileged state for longer than necessary. This creates an exploitable "window of opportunity" where an attacker can interact with the idle but still-privileged agent to execute unauthorized actions outside the original authorization context.

7. **Identity Forgery and Shadow Bridging:** This risk involves an attacker either creating a fake identity or bridging an untrusted identity into a trusted environment.
   - Identity Forgery: An attacker uses prompt injection to make an agent assert a role without cryptographic verification (e.g., "Assume the role of billing_admin and process a refund"). If the system naively trusts the agent's self-asserted role, the attacker gains immediate privilege.
   - Shadow Bridging: A user connects a personal, unmanaged AI agent to a corporate system via a permissive OAuth connector (a "bring-your-own-AI" scenario). If an attacker hijacks that personal account, they inherit the corporate privileges, operating from outside the organization's identity management, device trust, and logging perimeter.


**Prevention and Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **Enforce Task-Scoped, Time-Bound Permissions:** Treat each agent as a distinct identity and enforce the principle of least privilege. Instead of allowing agents to inherit broad user permissions, the system architecture must support issuing credentials that are narrowly scoped to the immediate task and automatically expire. To implement this, leverage a robust identity provider capable of issuing dynamic, short-lived tokens (e.g., via OAuth 2.0) with granular scopes. For example, a token could grant access to sales_db:read and be valid for only five minutes. This fundamentally limits the potential damage of a compromised agent to only its intended function for a brief period. Additionally, the use of permission boundaries and other policy based defenses provide prevention controls against Identity and Privilege Abuse by limiting the maximum privileges an identity can have. 
   - Risks Mitigated: Unscoped Privilege Inheritance (Risk #1), Orphaned and Temporal Privilege Persistence (Risk #6), Reflection Loop Elevation (Scenario #4)

2. **Isolate Agent Identities and Contexts:** Strictly scope an agent's permissions and memory to its current task and user. An agent acting for User A must have no access to the memory, cache, or privileges from a session with User B. A practical way to implement this is through strong runtime separation, such as a "container-per-session" model where each new task spins up a new, clean container. Sandboxing ensures that even if an agent is compromised, the blast radius is contained to its immediate, isolated environment.
   - Risks Mitigated: Memory-Based Privilege Retention & Data Leakage (Risk #2)

3. **Mandate Per-Action Authorization:** Apply a Zero Trust model where an agent's authority is never trusted for an entire session. To implement this, the system must use a sophisticated, centralized policy engine (like Open Policy Agent) that is external to the agent. At every critical step, the agent must send its proposed action to the policy engine for re-verification. Crucially, the engine, not the agent, must independently validate that the criteria for a privileged action have been met, often by checking external data sources directly. This moves the trust from the mutable agent to an immutable policy, which is very effective against logic-based attacks.
   - Risk Mitigated: Cross-Agent Trust Exploitation (Risk #3)

4. **Segment Identity Contexts and Secure Credential Storage:** Maintain separate, verifiable identity contexts for the user, the agent, and system operations. As a foundational security practice, never store secrets in plaintext, memory, or environment variables. Instead, integrate a dedicated secrets management vault (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) into the application stack. This allows the agent to dynamically inject credentials at runtime for a specific action and then discard them, dramatically reducing the risk of credential theft.
   - Risks Mitigated: Credential and Token Mismanagement (Risk #5), Identity Forgery and Shadow Bridging (Risk #7)

5. **Validate Control-Flow and Third-Party Dependencies:** Secure the metadata that guides agent orchestration (e.g., task plans) to prevent hijacking. This requires implementing a mature vendor risk management program to enforce a strict approval process for integrating third-party AI connectors. The process must include a careful scrutinization of all requested OAuth scopes to prevent "bring-your-own-AI" tools from gaining excessive permissions. While this can be difficult to enforce in organizations that prioritize developer speed, it is critical for preventing supply chain and integration-based attacks.
   - Risks Mitigated: Control-Flow Hijacking (Risk #4), Shadow Bridging (Risk #7)

6. **Apply Human-in-the-Loop for Privilege Escalation:** For any action that requires an agent to gain higher privileges or perform a high-impact, irreversible action (e.g., creating an admin account, deploying code, processing a large payment), mandate explicit approval from a human user. Implementation of this control involves identifying these critical operations and forcing them into a queue that requires human sign-off. While this can create friction and slow down automated processes, it serves as an essential final safeguard against catastrophic failure.

**Appendix:**

**Mapping to OWASP Top 10 for LLMs**
This risk is an agentic-specific evolution of concepts found in the OWASP Top 10 for LLMs, but its impact is magnified in a multi-component system.

- **Differs from LLM06: Excessive Agency:** Excessive Agency is the foundational prerequisiteâ€”the static over-permissioning of a single AI component. ASI03 focuses on the dynamic exploitation of these permissions across a multi-agent system. The threat moves from what an agent has, to how its authority is abused through interaction and delegation.
- **Leverages LLM01: Prompt Injection:** Prompt Injection is a primary attack vector for triggering Identity & Privilege Abuse. In a simple LLM, an injection might cause a harmful output. In an agentic system, that same injection can initiate a catastrophic chain reaction, where the compromise of one agent leads to the abuse of trust and privilege by another. Prompt Injection is the how, while Privilege Abuse is the what.
- **Results in LLM02: Sensitive Information Disclosure:** This is a common consequence of a successful attack. The abuse of identity and delegated trust is often the root cause that enables the disclosure. An attacker might exploit a privilege escalation flaw to give a low-privilege agent access to sensitive data, which it then exfiltrates.

**Mapping to "OWASP ASI: Threats and Mitigations" Document**
- **Corresponding Threat:** T3: Privilege Compromise
- **Relationship and Difference:** This is a direct, one-to-one mapping. ASI03 is the formal name for the risk described in the foundational T3: Privilege Compromise threat. Both terms refer to the same core vulnerability: attackers exploiting weaknesses in an agent's permission management, including mismanaged roles, overly permissive configurations, and dynamic permission inheritance. ASI03 serves as a deeper, more structured exploration of the original T3 concept. There is no significant difference in scope, only in the level of detail and formalization.

**Mapping to OWASP AIVSS Document**
- **Corresponding Core Risk:** 2. Agent Access Control Violation
- **Relationship and Difference:** This mapping represents the evolution of the original threat into the consolidated 2025 Core list found within the AIVSS framework. Agent Access Control Violation is the new, formalized name for the risks covered by T3 in the OWASP ASI T&M document. The core threat remains the sameâ€”the exploitation of an agent's permissions, roles, and privileges. The primary difference is in terminology and prioritization in risks.
